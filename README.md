# A simple photo viewer

### The app consists of three screens:

Profile Screen: Displays the user's name and address at the top, followed by a list of the userâ€™s albums. Albums can be fetched using the albums endpoint with the userId as a parameter.

Album Details Screen: Accessed by tapping an album from the profile screen. This screen retrieves images using the photos endpoint with the album ID and displays them in an Instagram-like grid. It also features a search bar to filter images by title, dynamically showing only related images as the user types.

Viewer Screen: Activated by selecting a specific image from the album details screen. This screen allows users to view the image in full screen with share options and a zoom feature for detailed viewing.

This structure enhances user experience by providing an intuitive flow from profiles to albums and image details.
